### The most basic ass headless theme going.

This theme facilitates headless WP development by being almost empty.

This should be used in conjunction with my wp build script (OSX only) or your own build script to spin up an instant headless wp installation, freeing you up to build out your front end with whatever you want, as long as it can consume the wordpress API.

This is very `in progress` at the minute - void.
